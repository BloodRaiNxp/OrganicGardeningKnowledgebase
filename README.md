# Organic Gardening Knowledgebase

## Overview
The Organic Gardening Knowledgebase, developed by C. Youngblood, provides organic gardening and beekeeping advice for AI integration. Tailored to USDA zones (e.g., Southeast Texas, Zones 8b–9a), it uses JSON files for machine-readable data and text files for flexibility, supporting AIs like Grok, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek. The repository is public for easy access, with a text summary for AIs unable to fetch files directly.

## Files
- **ai_instructions.json / ai_instructions.txt**: Guidelines for AI responses, ensuring concise, organic-focused advice with bee-safe practices.
- **gardening_resources.json / gardening_resources.txt**: 75 vetted resources (30 gardening, 45 beekeeping, e.g., Mann Lake, Bee Weaver).
- **organic_products.json / organic_products.txt**: OMRI-listed fertilizers (e.g., Wiggle Worm Castings) and pesticides (e.g., neem oil).
- **quick_start.txt**: Text summary for AIs without web access (e.g., ChatGPT), with key instructions and data.

## Usage
- **AI Integration**: AIs can parse JSON files via URLs (e.g., https://github.com/BloodRaiNxp/OrganicGardeningKnowledgebase/raw/main/ai_instructions.json) or use .txt files for plain text. For AIs without web access, copy-paste quick_start.txt or any .txt/.json file.
- **Client Message**: Paste into your AI: "Become my gardening and beekeeping assistant using the knowledgebase at https://github.com/BloodRaiNxp/OrganicGardeningKnowledgebase. If you can’t access the link, copy-paste quick_start.txt or the .txt/.json files."
- **Testing**: Designed for Southeast Texas (Zone 9a). Feedback welcome via GitHub issues.
- **Sourcing**: Compare prices at suppliers (e.g., https://www.mannlakeltd.com, https://www.beeweaver.com).
