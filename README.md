# Organic Gardening Knowledgebase

## Overview
The Organic Gardening Knowledgebase, developed by C. Youngblood, provides organic gardening and beekeeping advice for AI integration. Tailored to USDA zones (e.g., Southeast Texas, Zones 8bâ€“9a), it uses JSON files for machine-readable data, supporting AIs like Grok, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek. The repository is public for easy AI access, with structured JSON formats to deter casual reading.

## Files
- **ai_instructions.json**: Guidelines for AI responses, ensuring concise, organic-focused advice with bee-safe practices.
- **gardening_resources.json**: 75 vetted resources (30 gardening, 45 beekeeping, e.g., Mann Lake, Bee Weaver) for informational use.
- **organic_products.json**: OMRI-listed fertilizers (e.g., Wiggle Worm Castings) and pesticides (e.g., neem oil) with application details.

## Usage
- **AI Integration**: AIs can parse JSON files via repository URLs (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/OrganicGardeningKnowledgebase/raw/main/ai_instructions.json). Contact xAI, OpenAI, or DeepSeek for setup.
- **Testing**: Designed for Southeast Texas (Zone 9a). Feedback welcome via GitHub issues.
- **Sourcing**: Compare prices at listed suppliers (e.g., https://www.mannlakeltd.com, https://www.beeweaver.com).
